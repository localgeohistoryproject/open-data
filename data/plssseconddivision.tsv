1	A	Aliquot Part	t	An aliquot part is a division made by halving and quartering a section. These are identified by the cardinal position such as Northeast (NE).
2	B	Remainder Aliquot Part	f	Remainder Aliquot Parts are residuals or portions or significantly smaller than nominal aliquot parts. These may be left over after a special survey or other survey cuts into an existing aliquot part and a portion of the aliquot has not been designated as a government lot and is remaining as an aliquot part.
3	L	Lot	f	A subdivision of a section that is not designated as an aliquot part of a section and is identified by a number. A Government Lot, or Lot, may be regular or irregular in shape.
4	Q	Quarter Section	f	A quarter section is an aliquot part that divides the section into quarter parts only. In most cases quarter sections will be coded as A and the distinction between aliquot part and a quarter aliquot part is a state-by-state preference. The preferred coding is to use A for all aliquot parts.
5	O	Unnumbered Lot	f	An unnumbered government lot is an area of land that appears to be a government lot because of its location in the section and its acreage. Because Government Lots must be surveyed and have a number, it is expected that existing unnumbered government lots will gradually transition to either remainder aliquot parts or remainder government lots with a number.
6	V	Remainder Lot	f	A Remainder Government Lot or Remainder Lot are residuals or portions of Lots. These may be left over after a special survey or other survey cuts into an existing Lot.
7	U	Unsurveyed Protracted	f	Unsurveyed Protracted divisions are always aliquot parts but have not been measured by survey. The protraction diagram is a plan of survey.
8	Z	Unsurveyed Unprotracted	f	Unsurveyed Unprotracted divisions are always aliquot parts but there is no survey or plan of survey. These divisions have been termed extended PLSS or PLSS grids in some implementations.
