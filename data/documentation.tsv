6	law	Type	Gazettes and session laws often contain documents other than acts, such as joint resolutions, constitutional amendments, legal notices, and other types of appendices. The actual document type is included in this part.		en
7	law	Date	For most documents, the date the law was approved by the executive officer or a veto was overridden by the legislative body is used. An effective date or filing date may be used if no other date is known or readily available.		en
8	law	Session	This part is only used when necessary to distinguish a special session from a regular session.		en
9	law	Volume	In jurisdictions where the volume reference is the session year, this part is generally omitted unless the year does not match the date. In some jurisdictions, a volume may span over several physical books that may contain sub-volume numbers. These are generally not included if the pagination does not restart in each sub-volume.		en
10	law	Source	This part deviates from the model in that it generally uses the abbreviation found in the <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/IndigoBook.html">Indigo Book</a> instead of jurisdiction-specific abbreviations that often repeat between jurisdictions. If a particular volume uses overlapping page numbers, additional information may follow to identify in which section of a volume the document is located.		en
11	law	Page	When there is no page number or when it is not known (particularly in jurisdictions using electronic documents), a placeholder <span class="b">___</span> is used in its place.		en
12	law	Number	If the jurisdiction uses the word <span class="b">Chapter</span> instead of <span class="b">Number</span> to designate a document, the abbreviation <span class="b">Ch.</span> is used. Additionally, when there are overlapping document numbers within a volume for categories of documents within the same broad document type (e.g., general versus local acts), additional information may precede the number to identify the nature of the document. When there is no document number or when it is not known, a placeholder <span class="b">___</span> is used in its place.		en
13	law	Published	This part deviates from the model, and is only included when the source is a gazette with dated issues (e.g., <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">Federal Register</a>, <a href="https://www.pabulletin.com/index.asp">Pennsylvania Bulletin</a>).		en
14	law	Section	When a document distinguishes between document sections and code sections, document sections are used in this part.		en
15	law	Context	This part deviates from the model by using square brackets instead of parentheses. If used, this generally contains either a code section or a number to distinguish unnumbered items within a document section (e.g., <span class="b">[3]</span> may reference the third law listed in a repealer section).		en

18	governmentlevel	Municipality	Governments classified as minor civil divisions or incorporated places by the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/GARM/glosGARM.pdf">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative">OpenStreetMap administrative boundary</a> levels greater than 6. In general, the definition of Municipality in this resource is more broad than that used by many jurisdictions, which may limit the term to incorporated places only.		en
20	about_pa	Methodology	At the outset, the project's scope was limited to one county. The Recorder of Deeds's Charter Index and the Clerk of Courts's Miscellaneous Index were examined to locate pertinent matters. Court dockets were also reviewed both to locate pertinent matters and abstract relevant facts. Codes of ordinances for municipalities were examined for references to annexations, and ordinances were examined in a number of borough halls. Where records were missing or incomplete but references to boundary changes were found either in county records or published county histories, newspapers were consulted for copies of legal notices and general articles concerning court actions. Historical state codes were examined to determine the legal procedures and the agencies involved in such matters. A database was created to organize the information in a standardized fashion.</p><p>The scope of the project was expanded statewide, prioritizing boroughs and cities over townships, and prioritizing later events over newer. Geographic changes notes in published U.S. Census Bureau reports were transcribed from 1870 through the present, and pertinent information was abstracted into the database. Later, U.S. Census Bureau correspondence with municipal engineers and secretaries, which formed the basis for many of the notes, were examined and abstracted in part. Several counties surrounding the pilot county were also visited, also initially examining the Recorder of Deeds's Charter Index, some dockets held by the Clerk of Courts, and municipal codes held by county law libraries.</p><p>While there is no statewide record series covering all boundary changes, several state agency record series primarily covering the mid-20th Century were examined in detail, including Department of Education annexation files stored at the agency and the State Archives, along with Department of Community and Economic Development boundary change files. Later, home rule and optional plan files were also reviewed both at that department and at the Legislative Reference Bureau. Municipal codes at the State Library and available online were examined. An extract of Department of State Corporation Bureau records concerning boroughs was obtained, and pertinent filings in their &quot;Orphan&quot; microfilm collection containing microfilmed charter records from county Recorder of Deeds were examined.</p>Separately, portions of local legislation indexes by <a href="https://archive.org/stream/adigesttitlesco00beitgoog#page/n9/mode/1up">Calvin G. Beitel</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/stream/indextolocallegi00pric#page/n6/mode/1up">Giles D. Price</a> were converted into database tables and linked with auto-generated statute links. Acts incorporating boroughs and cities were located and abstracted from this data, with review of acts amending charters ongoing. Work Projects Administration compilations concerning municipal incorporation and boundaries were examined where available -- these are found in part in microfilmed files at the State Archives; in part in published inventories of county archives; and in part by happenstance at the county level, normally at the Recorder of Deeds or the Tax Assessment Office.<p>The remaining counties were also visited. In many counties, county histories were also referenced. Most counties do not maintain comprehensive indexes to Clerk of Courts records, necessitating a docket by docket search for pertinent cases. In most cases, pertinent court dockets from 1850 through 1975 have been reviewed.</p><p>Rather than routinely visit borough and city halls, as had been done in the pilot county, written requests were made on the basis of references found in reviewed U.S. Census Bureau records, municipal codes, and, in some cases, county records. In-person municipal hall visits were limited to situations where large amounts of records were involved, or where missing information or discrepancies required a more thorough examination of records.</p><p>Over time, other record series at the state level, such as appellate court dockets, reporters, and paper books, along with portions of the <a href="http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/rg/sd/r17sda.htm#17.522">Land Office Map Collection</a>, were examined. In order to fill in township formation dates that have not yet been researched in county records, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/incorporationdatespamunicipalities1965">1965 Department of Internal Affairs publication</a> containing incorporation dates was digitized and abstracted. U.S. Census Bureau enumeration district maps at the National Archives were also examined both as a rich source of mid-20th Century maps, as well as to evaluate discrepancies between U.S. Census Bureau reports and local government records. Additional maps available at the Library of Congress and repositories throughout Pennsylvania have also been examined.</p><p><a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2012.html">U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line Shapefiles, 2012 vintage,</a> were used to create the initial GIS base layer. Municipal boundaries were derived from the County Subdivision layer, and ward boundaries in Philadelphia were derived from the Voting Districts layer. Multipolygon features were split into polygon features, and data was converted to WGS 84 (EPSG:4326). In order to show changes in boundaries, features were further split into &quot;areas&quot; that share a common jurisdictional history, mostly based on data taken from boundary legal descriptions.</p><p>Accuracy of the source GIS data varies widely throughout Pennsylvania. Efforts have been made to conflate data to match newer vintages where the latter are more accurate or precise. In some cases, minor adjustments derived from alternate sources were made to municipal boundaries. Most of these adjustments were made after reviewing maps and primary source records described above in conjunction with other modern sources, such as, but not limited to: authoritative municipal maps (principally zoning maps); county tax assessment maps, parcel records, and, where accessible, GIS data (both municipal boundary and parcel layers); <a href="https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=2">municipal boundary data compiled by the PAMAP Program in 2007</a>; and <a href="https://data-pennshare.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/pennsylvania-municipality-boundary">PennDOT's Pennsylvania Municipal Boundary GIS layer</a>.		en
21	about_nj	Methodology	The tables in the New Jersey Geological and Water Survey's <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/enviroed/oldpubs/bulletin67.pdf">Bulletin 67, written by John P. Snyder,</a> were converted into database tables, and were then reformatted into a standardized format both for citation purposes and separately to act as the basis of the geohistory event records. Titles, page numbers, and dates of most of the cited laws were abstracted. In addition to reviewing the material in the bulletin, historical state codes were examined to determine the legal procedures and the agencies involved in such matters. A comprehensive review of indexes to the Secretary of State's Statutory/Miscellaneous Filing series, including from the State Archives's card catalog, the State Archives's electronic index, and the Secretary of State's electronic index, was completed. The previous year's index is continually requested on an annual basis to locate new filings. Every identified non-map instrument was examined and photographed. Separate Secretary of State County and Municipal Filings were also examined. A review of county record inventories, mostly from the late 1970s or early 1980s, at the State Archives was done to determine which counties had the municipal incorporation record books specified in N.J. Rev. Stat. 40:43-2. In several counties, such books that existed in inventories were unavailable; in at least one other county, a such book was located but was completely blank. Fewer than half of the total counties were determined to currently have books clearly qualifying, although some of the remaining counties had such instruments scattered among other books or docket boxes. In some counties, other types of record books at the County Clerk, such as partition books, division books, road books, incorporation books, miscellaneous books, street vacation books, or general deed indexes, were also examined in part.</p><p>Additional information concerning government form not addressed by Snyder's work has been incorporated. Older state incorporation date publications were referenced for information on the adoption of Commmissioner and Municipal Manager forms of government. County and Municipal Government Study Commission records at the State Archives were consulted for information about proceedings under the Optional Municipal Charter Law, and records from the Department of Community Affairs concerning the current classification of municipalities were obtained. Charter commission reports at the State Library and, in limited cases, at local libraries, were consulted.</p><p>A 2013 vintage of <a href="https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/municipal-boundaries-of-nj">NJGIN's Municipal Boundaries</a> GIS layer was used to create the initial GIS base layer. This source relied heavily on data from tax parcel maps and GIS features, and is consistently highly accurate throughout the state. <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html">U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a> were additionally used to determine state and county lines in the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean where state data did not recognize the territory to be divided into municipalities. Efforts have been made to conflate data to match newer vintages where the latter are more accurate or precise. Multipolygon features were split into polygon features, and data was converted to WGS 84 (EPSG:4326). Mapping boundary changes is only in preliminary stages. In order to show changes in boundaries, features were further split into &quot;areas&quot; that share a common jurisdictional history, taken both from Snyder and boundary legal descriptions. In some cases, minor adjustments derived from alternate sources were made to municipal boundaries, some of which were the result of minor boundary changes not yet captured in state data. Most of these adjustments were made after reviewing maps and primary source records described above in conjunction with other modern sources, such as municipal tax maps.		en
27	about_pa	Completeness	Incorporation events for all known boroughs, cities, and towns, along with all known home rule charter, optional charter, and optional plan adoptions, have been identified. Well over 95% of these events include primary source citations. Further, over 95% of current boroughs and cities have primary source citations for actions granting them the power to operate under the Borough Code or the Third Class City Code, respectively, in lieu of a legislative special charter. It is likely that over 90% of boundary changes to boroughs and cities from 1871 through 1974 have been identified. Annexations before 1871 may only be contained in municipal records, and are more likely to remain unidentified. Boundary changes after 1974 are also more likely to remain unidentified, in part due to the large increase in the volume of court records, in part due to confusion as to the court division in which these matters were to be filed, in part due to the difficulty of finding cases of this nature in the Common Pleas Case Management System (CPCMS) because of its focus on criminal matters, and in part due to both the lack of statutory guidance and the higher likelihood of improvident records disposition actions for annexation referenda only filed with the county board of elections.</p><p>All known townships have had a preliminary review to identify the probable formation date. Counties in Southeastern Pennsylvania formed prior to 1750 have mostly had detailed review of either road dockets or county commissioner minutes to determine when a township first had officers or taxes assessed. In most other counties, primary source citations for township formations and boundary changes may only be available when entered in the same court dockets as borough, city, and town events, and may be limited to after 1850. Often, court dockets may leave out key information, such as when or whether an action was finally approved, or may omit township formation events altogether. In these cases, court papers have only been examined in any detail in a limited number of counties.		en

31	about_	Priorities	Like many projects of this scale, the vast amount of knowledge to be uncovered often exceeds the resources available. The following priorities generally decide what information is included:</p><ul><li>Geohistory events for incorporated places, such as boroughs, cities, and villages, are prioritized over those for townships and other county subdivisions.</li><li>Incorporations, name changes, consolidations, mergers, disincorporations, and substantial government form change events are prioritized over annexations. In turn, annexations are prioritized over minor boundary adjustments and disputed boundary determinations.</li><li>Modern geohistory events, particularly since 1900, are prioritized over older geohistory events, which are often chronicled in preexisting county histories.</li><li>Identifying geohistory events and cataloging primary source citations is prioritized over GIS efforts.</li></ul><p>		en

50	disclaimer	Quality and Completeness	The data included in this resource is incomplete. Records from previous centuries do not contain as much information as desired. Certain primary records are inaccessible or no longer existent. Depending on the era, local government boundaries were able to be altered by municipal, county, state, provincial, federal, or royal officials, each maintaining their own sets of records, which may or may not have survived the test of time. Land surveys conducted prior to the invention of modern surveying equipment were often inaccurate, and may not align properly with other surveys of the same boundary.
