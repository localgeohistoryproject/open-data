1164	3280	Minute				"\tMayor Bracy read the following statements:\n\tOn April 19, a group of Citizens appeared before Council to announce their intention to have placed upon the ballot in the November elections the question as to whether or not a Charter Commission should be elected to study the form of government of the City of Allentown and to make recommendations thereon. At that time the spokesman for the group, Judge James F. Henninger suggested that Council might wish to adopt an Ordinance placing the question on the ballot and thus bypass the necessity of obtaining the signatures of 15% of the registered voters of the City of Allentown which state law otherwise requires. During the past week, we as members of Council have seriously considered the proposal advanced by this group of Citizens and after a thorough discussion of the accomplishments of the City of Allentown, we can not help but feel that our City has made great strides under our present form of Government, and have every reason to believe it could continue to do so.\n\tWe appreciate the concern of the citizens who presented this request and are aware of the alternate forms of government available to Third Class Cities. Since a referendum asking for a study could lead to an eventual change in the form of our government - a change which should be of vital interest to all of our citizens - City Council feels that the voters should not be by-passed in the initiation of this request. If 15% of the voters indicate their desire to have such a study made, then Council, as always, will be I happy to cooperate with any group or commission elected to study our form of government. If this is done, we believe an informed electorate will make the right choice."	113	114	1966-04-26				t			\N	1965-1968						
1165	3280	Minute				"\tThe Citizens for Efficient City Government requested to City Council to put the question of a charter commission study on the November ballot. Judge James F. Henninger, who is not a member of the special civic committee, appeared before Council in their behalf. This committee is made up of 14 persons affiliated with organizations representing some 2,000 persons. They are the Chamber of Commerce, the League of Women Voters, the Junior Woman's Club, the Junior Chamber of Commerce, the Jaycee Wives and the AFL-CIO Labor Council. Judge Henninger explained the Optional Charter Law of 1957, which gives the people the right to study their form of government and choose a new plan if they desire. A charter commission study would delve into the present commission form and compare it with the other two optional forms - the mayor-council plan and the council-manager plan. He stated that the study can be introduced in two ways: by petition of 15 per cent of the registered voters of the city, asking for referendum, or by ordinance passed by the Council putting the question on the ballot. He made it known that this request does not mean the present form of government is not a good one but it simply means that the committee and its sponsors feel a study of government should be made. This study, he remarked, would have no bearing on the relative merits of the three forms but would allow the people an opportunity to have the forms compared. In the event that Council rejects the committee's request and forces the petition procedure the committee would have to secure more than 7,000 signatures.\n\tOn motion of Mr. Grammes, seconded by Mr. Ritter, that Council review the matter and refer same to Council of the Whole. Yeas: Messrs. Grammes, Reinert, Ritter, Snyder and Bracy."	107	108	1966-04-19				t			\N	1965-1968

4794	5302	Minute	School District			"It was recommended that the Board direct the solicitor to prepare petitions to place the annexation of the Slippery Rock Area Elementary School property by Slippery Rock Borough on the spring primary ballot. The solicitor noted that the legislature has not yet voted a simple annex procedure. Therefore petitions must be circulated in Slippery Rock Township to request the annexation, and in Slippery Rock Borough to permit the annexation. The question would then be on the spring primary ballot in both municipalities. This was tried two years ago and not enough signatures were obtained. A certain percentage of those who voted in the last general election are needed. John Peterson moved to direct the Solicitor to prepare the necessary petitions to annex the land and building of Slippery Rock Area Elementary School into Slippery Rock Borough and to prepare the necessary petitions to permit the annexation by Slippery Rock Township residents. The motion was seconded by Asa Wiley and carried unanimously. It was noted that Slippery Rock Borough entirely surrounds this property."	283	283	1978-12-11				t			\N
